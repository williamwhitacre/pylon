# Pylon

## The Production Version of Scaffold

The big experiment, [Scaffold](https://github.com/williamwhitacre/scaffold), has been pruned to it's
most useful essentials, and the database API has been exposed. This takes only the best
architectural features from Scaffold, leaving a much more workable interface with very little bloat
to work through. Scaffold lives through Pylon, the refined and heavily pruned addition. Pylon does
not suffer from the same horrible type bloat and takes much better advantage of the Elm Architecture
overall.

Examples will be coming very soon, within two weeks. Enjoy!

_TODO : Write a variation of the
[Elm Architecture Tutorial](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial) which gently
introduces the many helpers provided and culminates in building a simple but fully fledged
application against Firebase using Pylon and ElmFire (with deepest appreciation and love to
[Thomas Weiser](https://github.com/ThomasWeiser) for his amazing work)._
